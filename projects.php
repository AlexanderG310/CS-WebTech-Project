echo '<h3 class="headerAlt">Discord Bot (Using Python)</h3>
          <p>For this project I created a small Discord bot that would reply to users by users using command like prompts to get a response from the bot. For example !hello would make the bot replay with a waving emote or simply say hello back and mention the user. Another thing I would learn to do is make the bot play videos in a voice channel, whether they be from the bots storage device or download and play (audio only) Youtube videos!</p>

		  <h3 class="headerAlt">Discord Bot (Using Javascript)</h3>
          <p>I tried to create a Javascript bot for Discord once as well. That, however, did not make it very far. The most I could do was make it reply and say hello, but it did help me learn at least a little bit of Javascript.</p>

		  <h3 class="headerAlt">Blender 3D APC Model (Armoured Personnel Carrier)</h3>
          <p>This was one of my simpler models I created in Blender. While this was an idea that came up to me during High School (A Game Dev Class) I decided to work on that in my own time. It wasn\'t too bad, I learned a lot about 3D modeling from it. A family member also decided to practice programming it so it could move and shoot.</p>

echo '<li>
		  <h3 class="headerAlt">Blender 3D Walker Model</h3>
          <p>This is another model I created outside of school. It was much more detail than the APC Model I created and I had also begin to experiment with animations to make it move. I felt pretty satisfied with it as it would give me more experience to modeling and expose me to a bit of animation. I also got the inspiration from the AT-ST from Star Wars!</p>
