## Personal Website Project
The following files and folders are a website I made while taking a WebTech class during my Fall semester in 2022.

Uses PHP and JS. The database that was used in this project was MySQL along with phpMyAdmin to administrate the database.

Also uses jQuery to use some of the provided aJax methods so that content (such as comments) can be displayed asynchronously.
