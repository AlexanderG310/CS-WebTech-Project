          <p>I stepped up for becoming a Project Manager for my group in a Software Engineering class I took during <b>Spring 2022</b>. For this project I did a variety of different class to lead my group. I created a variety of stories, attempted to architect how everything would work, and suggested ideas to my team. </p>

          <h3 class = "headerAlt">Discord Bots</h3>
          <p>As a small side projects for the summers between my semesters I would make about 3 different Discord Bots using Python which do some small tasks. One of them could join a voice channel and play audio to users in the voice channel. Another could log messages in public channels, display random emotes with commands, and do other fun stuff.</p>

          <h3 class = "headerAlt">Service Now Training</h3>
          <p>A family member who is also a software engineer has been slowly showing me how to use Service Now for when in the future, when I get a job that uses ServiceNow, I can be ready.</p>

          <h3 class = "headerAlt">Wireshark Knowledge</h3>
          <p>I took a networking class which would bring me to explore Wireshark - a tool used for sniffing packets arriving and leaving a network. I would explore more on how to use this tool to see any potential malicious packets or unknown connections arriving to our network.</p>
